let me give you an idea of how the exam portal   │
│   timming works . the student starts the exam      │
│   from @components/classroom/examViewComponents/M  │
│   yTestSeries.js where there are 2 types of exam   │
│   shown that go to same Exam Portal i.e Schdeuled  │
│   Exam and Practice Exam. For Schdeule Exam the    │
│   start exam button appears based on System        │
│   Timming but when he clicks on Start Exam a       │
│   server function validates the actual time and    │
│   does not let the student go to the exam page .   │
│   the student is given a buffer time of 2-3 mins   │
│   i dont know exactly to go to exam portal         │
│   earlier but this happens only when he changes    │
│   the system time forward . so as also he wont     │
│   reach the exact exam portal page too earlier     │
│   and also cant go the exam page exactly because   │
│   the exam page requires id of the exam which is   │
│   not exposed to him . then talking about          │
│   duration of exam . for scheduled exam duration   │
│   is based on end time of the exam that info       │
│   comes from server and the timer in the exam      │
│   portal always readjust when the student          │
│   bymistakly goes out and comes to the exam page   │
│   again with coninue exam option where the timer   │
│   is readjusted again with end time . for          │
│   practice exam the timing security does not       │
│   matter because it does not require any strict    │
│   timing requirement and it is build for the       │
│   student to have fair timing practice and does    │
│   not require any timing security .
