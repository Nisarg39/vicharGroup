## üìã Complete BMAD Development Workflows

### Full Feature Development Cycle
```
Example: Adding Real-time Exam Monitoring

1. /analyst - "Research requirements for real-time exam monitoring"
   ‚Üí Analyzes user needs, technical constraints, competitive landscape

2. /pm - "Create a PRD for real-time exam monitoring based on the analysis"
   ‚Üí Defines features, user stories, success metrics, timeline

3. /architect - "Design the technical architecture for real-time monitoring"
   ‚Üí Plans WebSocket implementation, database schema, API design

4. /scrum - "Break down the monitoring PRD into sprint stories"
   ‚Üí Creates user stories, estimates story points, plans 3 sprints

5. /dev - "Implement the real-time monitoring WebSocket connection"
   ‚Üí Writes production code with error handling and testing

6. /qa - "Test the real-time monitoring for performance and edge cases"
   ‚Üí Creates test plans, identifies bugs, validates performance

7. /ui - "Polish the monitoring dashboard interface"
   ‚Üí Ensures design consistency, accessibility, responsive design

8. /structure - "Review the monitoring code organization"
   ‚Üí Suggests improvements, identifies refactoring opportunities
```

### Bug Fix Workflow
```
Example: Fixing Exam Submission Issues

1. /qa - "Document and analyze the exam submission bug"
   ‚Üí Reproduces issue, identifies root cause, assesses impact

2. /architect - "Design a solution for the submission reliability issue"
   ‚Üí Plans technical approach, considers edge cases

3. /dev - "Implement the exam submission fix"
   ‚Üí Writes code fix with proper error handling and tests

4. /qa - "Verify the fix and perform regression testing"
   ‚Üí Confirms fix works, ensures no new issues introduced
```

### Performance Optimization Workflow
```
Example: Optimizing Exam Loading Performance

   ‚Üí Runs performance tests, identifies slow queries/components

2. /architect - "Design optimization strategy for faster exam loading"
   ‚Üí Plans database optimization, caching strategy, code splitting

3. /dev - "Implement performance optimizations"
   ‚Üí Optimizes queries, adds caching, implements lazy loading

4. /qa - "Validate performance improvements"
   ‚Üí Measures improvements, ensures targets met
```

### Quality Assurance
- **Before Commits**: Hooks automatically run lint and build
- **Code Reviews**: Use agents for architectural guidance
- **Performance**: Monitor with `/architect` recommendations

### Development Best Practices
- **Research First**: Use search tools to understand existing code
- **Plan Complex Tasks**: Break into smaller, testable components
- **Follow Patterns**: Check existing components before creating new ones
- **Security Focus**: Validate inputs, protect sensitive data
- **Performance Aware**: Optimize queries, bundle size, loading

## üéì Learning BMAD Method
