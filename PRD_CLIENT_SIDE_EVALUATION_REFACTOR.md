- **Database Bottleneck:** MongoDB M10 limits at 100 IOPS, restricting to 8-12 submissions/minute
- **Scalability Crisis:** Cannot handle 500+ concurrent submissions (takes 25-30+ minutes)
- **Duplicate Computation:** Client progressive scoring + full server re-computation creates redundancy
- **Resource Waste:** 90% server CPU usage during peak loads with 50-100MB memory per submission

### 1.2 Solution Overview

- **Scalability:** 3x throughput improvement (500 → 1,500 concurrent submissions)
- **Cost Reduction:** 70% database query reduction, 90% memory usage reduction
- **User Experience:** Real-time progressive scoring with immediate submission confirmation

### 1.4 Success Metrics
- Server processing time: <240ms (target: 90-150ms)
- Concurrent user capacity: 1,500+ students
- Computation accuracy: 99.9%+ match with current server logic
- Zero data loss guarantee with comprehensive fallback system
