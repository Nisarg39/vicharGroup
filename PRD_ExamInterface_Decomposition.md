# Product Requirements Document: ExamInterface Component Decomposition

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
The current ExamInterface.js component is a 2,358-line monolithic component with 72+ useState/useEffect hooks causing significant performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, and maintenance challenges. This single component serves as a critical point of failure for the exam portal system that needs to support 2,000+ concurrent users.

### Proposed Solution
Decompose the monolithic ExamInterface.js into a modular, performance-optimized architecture with five specialized components: ExamOrchestrator (thin coordinator), ExamStateManager (centralized state), ExamTimerService (isolated timer), SubjectNavigationManager (subject switching), and QuestionDisplayController (optimized rendering).

### Success Metrics & Business Impact
- **Performance**: 90% reduction in unnecessary re-renders, 60% reduction in memory usage
- **Scalability**: Support for 2,000+ concurrent users (4x current capacity)
- **Development Velocity**: 3x faster development cycle
- **Maintenance**: 50% reduction in bug resolution time
- **Mobile Performance**: 50% improvement in mobile responsiveness

### Timeline & Resource Requirements
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Core architecture setup and ExamOrchestrator
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4)**: State management and timer service decomposition  
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6)**: Subject navigation and question display optimization
- **Phase 4 (Week 7)**: Integration testing and performance validation

## Current State Analysis

### Component Metrics
- **Total Lines**: 2,358 lines of code
- **React Hooks**: 72+ useState/useEffect hooks
- **Sub-components**: 8 imported components
- **Progressive Integration**: Advanced scoring system integrated
- **Performance Issues**: Memory leaks, render bottlenecks, single point of failure

### Technical Debt Identified
1. **State Management Chaos**: 72+ hooks causing state confusion and race conditions
2. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Excessive re-renders across unrelated functionality
3. **Mobile Performance**: Poor optimization for mobile devices
4. **Maintenance Overhead**: Single file changes require extensive testing
5. **Testing Complexity**: Monolithic structure makes unit testing nearly impossible
