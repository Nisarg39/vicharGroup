# MHT-CET Subject Locking Fix - Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive fix implemented for the critical MHT-CET subject locking issues that were compromising exam integrity for scheduled exams.

## Problem Summary

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Scheduled Exam Logic Failure**: Unlocked Biology/Maths after 90 minutes from start instead of in the LAST 90 minutes before exam ends
2. **Conflicting Functions**: `shouldUnlockSubjects()` and `getSubjectUnlockSchedule()` had different logic
3. **Edge Case Failures**: Late starts, interrupted exams, and cross-midnight exams failed
4. **Integration Issues**: ExamInterface.js used wrong function for scheduled exams

## Root Cause Analysis

The core problem was that `getSubjectUnlockSchedule()` function (used by ExamInterface.js) implemented incorrect logic for scheduled exams:

### ❌ Previous Broken Logic:
```javascript
// Always used elapsed time from student start - WRONG for scheduled exams
const timeElapsed = currentTime - startTime.getTime();
const isLocked = timeElapsed < unlockTimeMs;
```

### ✅ Fixed Logic:
```javascript
// Correctly handles scheduled vs practice exams
if (exam.examAvailability === 'scheduled' && exam.endTime) {
    // For scheduled exams: unlock when 90 minutes remain until exam.endTime
    const examEndTime = new Date(exam.endTime).getTime();
    const timeRemainingUntilEnd = examEndTime - currentTime;
    shouldUnlockRestricted = timeRemainingUntilEnd <= ninetyMinutesMs;
} else {
    // For practice exams: unlock after 90 minutes from student start time
    const timeElapsed = currentTime - startTime.getTime();
    shouldUnlockRestricted = timeElapsed >= ninetyMinutesMs;
}
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `/utils/examDurationHelpers.js`
**Function**: `getSubjectUnlockSchedule()`
**Changes**:
- ✅ Fixed scheduled exam logic to use `exam.endTime` instead of elapsed time
- ✅ Added comprehensive edge case handling
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility for practice exams
- ✅ Added proper remaining time calculations

### 2. `/utils/examTimingUtils.js`
**Function**: `shouldUnlockSubjects()`
**Changes**:
- ✅ Enhanced edge case handling for consistency
- ✅ Added parameter for startTime (optional, for future compatibility)
- ✅ Improved defensive programming

### 3. `/utils/mhtCetTimingTests.js` (NEW)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive test suite
**Features**:
- ✅ 14 comprehensive test cases
- ✅ Covers all edge cases and scenarios
- ✅ Tests both functions for consistency
- ✅ Validates scheduled vs practice exam behavior

## Detailed Changes

### examDurationHelpers.js Changes

#### Before (Lines 88-106):
```javascript
const currentTime = Date.now();
const timeElapsed = currentTime - startTime.getTime();

Object.entries(streamConfig.subjectTimings).forEach(([subject, config]) => {
    const unlockTimeMs = config.unlockDelay * 60 * 1000;
    const isLocked = timeElapsed < unlockTimeMs;
    // ... rest of logic based on elapsed time
});
```

#### After (Lines 88-160):
```javascript
const currentTime = Date.now();
const ninetyMinutesMs = 90 * 60 * 1000;

// FIXED: Handle scheduled vs practice exams differently
let shouldUnlockRestricted = false;

if (exam.examAvailability === 'scheduled' && exam.endTime) {
    // For scheduled exams: unlock when 90 minutes remain until exam.endTime
    const examEndTime = new Date(exam.endTime).getTime();
    const timeRemainingUntilEnd = examEndTime - currentTime;
    shouldUnlockRestricted = timeRemainingUntilEnd <= ninetyMinutesMs;
    
    // EDGE CASE: Negative time remaining (exam ended)
    if (timeRemainingUntilEnd < 0) {
        shouldUnlockRestricted = true;
    }
} else {
    // For practice exams: unlock after 90 minutes from start
    const timeElapsed = currentTime - startTime.getTime();
    shouldUnlockRestricted = timeElapsed >= ninetyMinutesMs;
    
    // EDGE CASE: Negative elapsed time (clock issues)
    if (timeElapsed < 0) {
        shouldUnlockRestricted = false;
    }
}
```

## Test Scenarios Covered

### ✅ Scheduled Exam Tests:
1. **Normal Flow**: Student starts on time, unlock 90min before end
2. **Unlock Threshold**: Exactly 90min remaining triggers unlock
3. **Late Start**: Student starts with <90min left, immediate unlock
4. **Cross-midnight**: Exam spanning midnight works correctly
5. **Interrupted**: Student pauses/resumes, unlock based on end time

### ✅ Practice Exam Tests:
6. **Normal Flow**: Unlock after 90min from start
7. **Before Threshold**: Locked when <90min elapsed
8. **Variable Duration**: Works with 120min, 180min, 240min exams

### ✅ Edge Case Tests:
9. **Exam Ended**: Everything unlocked if exam already ended
10. **Clock Issues**: Future start times handled gracefully

### ✅ Stream Compatibility Tests:
11. **NEET**: No subject restrictions (all unlocked)
12. **JEE**: No subject restrictions (all unlocked)

### ✅ Function Consistency Tests:
13. **Scheduled Consistency**: Both functions return same result
14. **Practice Consistency**: Both functions return same result

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Late Start Scenario
**Problem**: Student starts exam with <90min remaining
**Solution**: Immediate unlock when `timeRemainingUntilEnd <= 90min`

```javascript
// Example: Exam ends in 60min, student just started
const timeRemainingUntilEnd = 60 * 60 * 1000; // 60min in ms
const shouldUnlock = timeRemainingUntilEnd <= (90 * 60 * 1000); // true
```

### 2. Interrupted Exam Scenario
**Problem**: Student pauses/resumes, elapsed time doesn't match schedule
**Solution**: Always base on exam.endTime, ignore student elapsed time

```javascript
// Scheduled exam: Base on endTime regardless of student start time
if (exam.examAvailability === 'scheduled' && exam.endTime) {
    const examEndTime = new Date(exam.endTime).getTime();
    const timeRemainingUntilEnd = examEndTime - Date.now();
    // Student interruptions don't affect unlock timing
}
```

### 3. Cross-Midnight Exam
**Problem**: Exam crosses midnight causing date calculation issues
**Solution**: Use milliseconds since epoch for accurate time calculations

```javascript
// Date.getTime() returns milliseconds since epoch, handles midnight correctly
const examEndTime = new Date(exam.endTime).getTime(); // Always accurate
```

### 4. Exam Already Ended
**Problem**: Student accesses exam after it has ended
**Solution**: Unlock everything if exam ended

```javascript
if (timeRemainingUntilEnd < 0) {
    shouldUnlockRestricted = true; // Unlock everything
}
```

### 5. Clock Synchronization Issues
**Problem**: Student clock vs server clock discrepancies
**Solution**: Defensive programming with bounds checking

```javascript
// Handle negative elapsed time (clock issues)
if (timeElapsed < 0) {
    shouldUnlockRestricted = false; // Keep locked
}
```

## Backward Compatibility

### ✅ Practice Exams Continue Working:
- Same unlock logic: 90 minutes from student start
- No changes to existing behavior
- All variable durations supported

### ✅ NEET/JEE Exams Unaffected:
- No subject restrictions maintained
- All subjects unlocked immediately
- Stream detection logic preserved

### ✅ API Compatibility:
- Function signatures unchanged
- Return value formats maintained
- Optional parameters added for future use

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing:
```javascript
// Run comprehensive test suite
import { runMHTCETTimingTests } from './utils/mhtCetTimingTests.js';
const results = runMHTCETTimingTests();
console.log(`${results.passedTests}/${results.totalTests} tests passed`);
```

### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Create MHT-CET scheduled exam ending in 2 hours
- [ ] Start exam, verify Biology/Maths locked
- [ ] Fast-forward to 90min before end, verify unlock
- [ ] Test late start (join with <90min left)
- [ ] Test practice exam with 90min elapsed time
- [ ] Verify NEET/JEE exams unaffected

## Rollout Approach

### Phase 1: Staging Testing (Recommended)
1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Run automated test suite
3. Create test scheduled MHT-CET exams
